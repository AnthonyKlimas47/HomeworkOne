    <!--Text for the history of the Boston Bruins-->
    <div class="text-box">
        <p class="first-paragraph">The Boston Bruins are an original six hockey team in the NHL and the 3rd oldest team in the NHL.
            They were founded November 1, 1924 by Charles Francis Adams. The Bruins were actually the first United States entry into the league.
            The Bruins first Stanley Cup win was in 1929. The stars that were in this era were Eddie Shore and Tiny Thompson.
            The Bruins next two Stanley Cup wins were in the early 1970s, in 1970 and 1972.
            Some popular players who were on the team in this era were Bobby Orr, Phil Esposito, and Johnny Bucyk.
            Bobby Orr was one of the greatest defensemen of all time, and is famous for his game-winning goal in the 1970s Stanley Cup Final.
            The Bruins were consistently competitive in the 1990s and 2000s but struggled to win any championships. They reached the finals in 1988 and 1990 but lost both times.
            The 1990s Bruins had players like Ray Bourque and Cam Neely. The Bruins won another championship in 2011, ending their 39-year drought.
            They defeated the Vancouver Canucks in a 7-game series and were considered underdogs throughout all of the playoffs. They made it to the finals just 2 years later in 2013, but lost to the Chicago Blackhawks.
            In recent years, the Bruins have been competitive with players like Brad Marchand, Patrice Bergeron, and David Pastrnak. All three of them played on a line together and were good enough to get the name "The Perfection Line."
            The Bruins' home arena is called TD Garden, located in Boston, Massachusetts. This is also where the Boston Celtics play. The Bruins have had a long rivalry with the Montreal Canadiens, which is one of the most well-known rivalries in NHL history.
            Other notable rivalries are with the Toronto Maple Leafs and the New York Rangers.</p>
